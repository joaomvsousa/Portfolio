## [PROJECT 1 - UK E-commerce Sales Analysis](https://github.com/joaomvsousa/UK-E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis)

### This project utilizes Tableau BI dashboards, alongside other tools like Python and machine learning, to derive actionable insights for enhancing business strategies across various areas:

- **Evaluate Company Performance:** Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total transactions, and average order value (AOV).
- **Increase Sales and Optimize Operations:** Identify sales patterns and growth opportunities to drive sales and streamline operations.
- **Personalize Marketing:** Implement RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for effective customer segmentation and targeted marketing efforts.
- **Reduce Customer Churn:** Identify at-risk customers and develop targeted retention strategies to decrease churn.
- **Enhance Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Calculate CLV and analyze customer behavior to maximize long-term profitability.
- **Optimize Inventory and Product Offerings:** Machine learning was used for market basket analysis to improve product mix and identify cross-selling opportunities

## [PROJECT 2 - Evaluating Vanguard's New Website Layout: A/B Test Impact on User Experience](https://github.com/joaomvsousa/Vanguard-A-B-Test-Experiment) 

### This project aimed to assess the impact of Vanguardâ€™s new website layout on user experience and process completion rates. Python was used for data wrangling and statistical analysis, with results detailed in a PowerPoint presentation

- **Experimental Setup:** Conducted from March 15, 2017, to June 20, 2017, with a control group using the traditional layout and a test group using the new layout, following the same process sequence.
- **Data Preparation:** Extensive data cleaning and wrangling were carried out using Python, including handling missing values, duplicates, and excluding outliers to ensure accuracy. 
- **Metrics Analyzed:** Examined time spent on each step, completion rates, and error rates using T-tests and Z-tests to compare performance between the control and test groups.
- **Findings:** The new layout improved time spent and reduced error rates but did not achieve the expected 5% increase in completion rates and had higher initial step errors, indicating that the redesign's investment may not be justified.
