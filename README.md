## Welcome to My Data-Driven Journey

I’m Joao Sousa, and I’m passionate about using data to solve real-world challenges. For me, data is more than just numbers—it’s a powerful tool for uncovering insights and driving meaningful change.

In this portfolio, you’ll see how I approach complex problems with a data-driven mindset, transforming raw datasets into clear insights and actionable strategies. Every project here is fully conceptualized, designed, and executed by me. These aren’t off-the-shelf examples; they’re original works, carefully planned and developed to address specific challenges.

Explore my projects below to see how I blend creativity with precision in data analysis.

## [PROJECT 1 - UK E-commerce Sales Analysis](https://github.com/joaomvsousa/UK-E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis)

**This project utilizes Tableau BI dashboards, alongside other tools like Python and machine learning, to derive actionable insights for enhancing business strategies across various areas:**

- Evaluate Company Performance: Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total transactions, and average order value (AOV).
  
- Increase Sales and Optimize Operations: Identify sales patterns and growth opportunities to drive sales and streamline operations.
  
- Personalize Marketing: Implement RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for effective customer segmentation and targeted marketing efforts.
  
- Reduce Customer Churn: Identify at-risk customers and develop targeted retention strategies to decrease churn.
  
- Enhance Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate CLV and analyze customer behavior to maximize long-term profitability.
  
- Optimize Inventory and Product Offerings: Machine learning was used for market basket analysis to improve product mix and identify cross-selling opportunities

## [PROJECT 2 - Evaluating Vanguard's New Website Layout: A/B Test Impact on User Experience](https://github.com/joaomvsousa/Vanguard-A-B-Test-Experiment) 

**This project aimed to assess the impact of Vanguard’s new website layout on user experience and process completion rates. Python was used for data wrangling and statistical analysis, with results detailed in a PowerPoint presentation.**

- Experimental Setup: Conducted from March 15, 2017, to June 20, 2017, with a control group using the traditional layout and a test group using the new layout, following the same process sequence.
  
- Data Preparation: Extensive data cleaning and wrangling were carried out using Python, including handling missing values, duplicates, and excluding outliers to ensure accuracy.
   
- Metrics Analyzed: Examined time spent on each step, completion rates, and error rates using T-tests and Z-tests to compare performance between the control and test groups.
  
- Findings: The new layout improved time spent and reduced error rates but did not achieve the expected 5% increase in completion rates and had higher initial step errors, indicating that the redesign's investment may not be justified.

## [PROJECT 3 - Turning Hotel Booking Data into Actionable Insights](https://github.com/joaomvsousa/hotel-booking-analysis) 

**This project utilized Python for data cleaning, handling missing values, and managing duplicates, and employed Tableau for interactive visualizations. The exploratory data analysis focused on booking data from two hotels—one in a city and another in a resort area. Key insights uncovered include:**

- Seasonal Trends: Identified clear patterns in booking demand throughout the year, enabling hotels to adjust pricing strategies and staffing levels according to peak and off-peak seasons.
  
- Cancellation Hotspots: Revealed high cancellation rates across both hotels, with specific booking channels contributing significantly to cancellations. This insight can guide hotels in addressing issues with these channels to minimize lost bookings.
  
- Timing of Cancellations: Analyzed cancellation patterns based on lead time, helping hotels predict when cancellations are most likely and allowing for better planning to mitigate last-minute losses.
  
- Room Preferences: Discovered insights into guest preferences for different room types, aiding hotels, travel agents, and tour operators in tailoring their offerings to various guest segments and potentially reducing cancellations.
  
- Impact and Application: Demonstrated the value of detailed data analysis in the hospitality industry, offering actionable insights to enhance revenue, optimize operations, and improve guest experiences.

## [PROJECT 4 - TechMeUp dashboard: Empowering Students to Achieve Tech Careers](https://public.tableau.com/views/TechmeUp/TechMeUp?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true&:toolbar=no) 

**This project involved the development of an interactive dashboard to showcase the transformative impact of TechMeUp, a Dutch NGO dedicated to helping students break into the tech industry by offering financial support for education. Utilizing Python for data preparation and Tableau for visualizations, the dashboard provides comprehensive insights into the journey and success of TechMeUp students over the last four years.** 

- Evaluate Student Success and Career Impact: Analyze key metrics such as the number of students supported, career achievements, and average job search durations.

 - Support Data-Driven Decision Making: The dashboard empowers TechMeUp and its partners to identify trends in student career paths, training center popularity, and job placement success rates.

- Tailor Recruitment and Career Support: By analyzing language proficiency and job search times, recruiters can better understand how language skills impact job placements and develop strategies to connect with top talent.

- Optimize Educational and Training Programs: Detailed breakdowns of student preferences for various tech training centers allow TechMeUp to refine partnerships and improve offerings to future students.

- Interactive Map with Drill-Down Functionality: A map built in Tableau allows users to drill down from province to city level, helping uncover hidden tech talent across the Netherlands. Recruiters can explore specific locations to find candidates who match their hiring needs.

- Detailed Table for In-Depth Analysis: At the end of the dashboard, a detailed table provides granular data on individual students, including their chosen career path, training center, language proficiency, and job search status. This feature offers a comprehensive view for users looking for specific candidate profiles.

Leverage Interactive Filters: The dashboard features filters by career field, training center, and job search timeline, providing users with a customizable experience to explore the data relevant to their needs.
