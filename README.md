# <p align="center">Welcome to My Data-Driven Journey </p>

I’m Joao Sousa, and I’m deeply passionate about using data to tackle real-world challenges. For me, data is more than just numbers; it’s a powerful tool for uncovering solutions and driving meaningful change.

In this portfolio, you’ll discover how I approach complex problems with a data-driven mindset, turning intricate datasets into clear insights and actionable strategies. My mission is to leverage data not only to analyze but to create meaningful solutions that make a difference.

Explore my projects bellow to see how I bring creativity and precision to data analysis. 

## [PROJECT 1 - UK E-commerce Sales Analysis](https://github.com/joaomvsousa/UK-E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis)

**This project utilizes Tableau BI dashboards, alongside other tools like Python and machine learning, to derive actionable insights for enhancing business strategies across various areas:**

- Evaluate Company Performance: Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total transactions, and average order value (AOV).
  
- Increase Sales and Optimize Operations: Identify sales patterns and growth opportunities to drive sales and streamline operations.
  
- Personalize Marketing: Implement RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for effective customer segmentation and targeted marketing efforts.
  
- Reduce Customer Churn: Identify at-risk customers and develop targeted retention strategies to decrease churn.
  
- Enhance Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate CLV and analyze customer behavior to maximize long-term profitability.
  
- Optimize Inventory and Product Offerings: Machine learning was used for market basket analysis to improve product mix and identify cross-selling opportunities

## [PROJECT 2 - Evaluating Vanguard's New Website Layout: A/B Test Impact on User Experience](https://github.com/joaomvsousa/Vanguard-A-B-Test-Experiment) 

**This project aimed to assess the impact of Vanguard’s new website layout on user experience and process completion rates. Python was used for data wrangling and statistical analysis, with results detailed in a PowerPoint presentation.**

- Experimental Setup: Conducted from March 15, 2017, to June 20, 2017, with a control group using the traditional layout and a test group using the new layout, following the same process sequence.
  
- Data Preparation: Extensive data cleaning and wrangling were carried out using Python, including handling missing values, duplicates, and excluding outliers to ensure accuracy.
   
- Metrics Analyzed: Examined time spent on each step, completion rates, and error rates using T-tests and Z-tests to compare performance between the control and test groups.
  
- Findings: The new layout improved time spent and reduced error rates but did not achieve the expected 5% increase in completion rates and had higher initial step errors, indicating that the redesign's investment may not be justified.

## [PROJECT 3 - Turning Hotel Booking Data into Actionable Insights](https://github.com/joaomvsousa/hotel-booking-analysis) 

**This project utilized Python for data cleaning, handling missing values, and managing duplicates, and employed Tableau for interactive visualizations. The exploratory data analysis focused on booking data from two hotels—one in a city and another in a resort area. Key insights uncovered include:**

- Seasonal Trends: Identified clear patterns in booking demand throughout the year, enabling hotels to adjust pricing strategies and staffing levels according to peak and off-peak seasons.
  
- Cancellation Hotspots: Revealed high cancellation rates across both hotels, with specific booking channels contributing significantly to cancellations. This insight can guide hotels in addressing issues with these channels to minimize lost bookings.
  
- Timing of Cancellations: Analyzed cancellation patterns based on lead time, helping hotels predict when cancellations are most likely and allowing for better planning to mitigate last-minute losses.
  
- Room Preferences: Discovered insights into guest preferences for different room types, aiding hotels, travel agents, and tour operators in tailoring their offerings to various guest segments and potentially reducing cancellations.
  
- Impact and Application: Demonstrated the value of detailed data analysis in the hospitality industry, offering actionable insights to enhance revenue, optimize operations, and improve guest experiences.
